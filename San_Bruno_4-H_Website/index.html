								<h2>History</h2>
								<p>Since its humble beginnings more than 100 years ago, 4-H has grown to become the nation’s largest youth development organization. The 4-H idea is simple: help young people and their families gain the skills they need to be proactive forces in their communities and develop ideas for a more innovative economy. That idea was the catalyst to begin the 4-H movement, and those values continue today. As one of the first youth development organizations in America, 4-H opened the door for young people to learn leadership skills and explore ways to give back. 4-H revolutionized how youth connected to practical, hands-on learning experiences while outside of the classroom.</p>

								<h2>What has 4-H done for San Bruno?</h2>
								<p>The San Bruno 4-H club is very active about participating in community events. We can be seen at Operation Clean Sweep in May, the Posy Parade in June, and Food and Clothing drives throughout the year. We also encourage all our members to exhibit project accomplishments in the San Mateo County Fair every June and many of our projects (be they animal exhibits, or clothing or artwork) can be seen on display in the large animal barn and 4-H exhibit hall.</p>

								<h2>How does 4-H work?</h2>
								<p>The San Bruno 4-H Club has a small farm and club house in San Bruno. The club offers hands-on projects and activities, directed by adult volunteers, for youth ages 5–19. Each youth member enrolls in the projects they are interested in, plus they attend monthly general meetings, fun days, farm clean-up days, and other organized club activities. A unique aspect of 4-H is that the club is run by the youth officers and members, so members learn leadership, good citizenship, and active participation in governance.</p>
